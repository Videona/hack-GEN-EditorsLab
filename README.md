# hack-GEN-EditorsLab2018

After four years of hard work we came here today to win a very special hackathon called Editors Lab 2018. The purpose of this conquest is bring to the news market a tech solution to improve the workflow in newsrooms. 

To understand why and how we ended up the journey here we are going to explain our history.

In 2014 we founded Videona with the aim of breaking the editing barrier because we think people know how to read audiovisual content but not quite how to write it. So, we started developing a video app for smartphone that enabled every consumer with an smartphone to record edit and share short videos. 

After two years we decided to pivot to a more narrow target and specialize in journalism. Our #MoJo's or mobile journalist community has welcome our decision beause our actual purpose is to improve their workflow and try to fight fakenews. 

We have been developing the camera options to offer professional quality results. Also an editing tool that enables you to cut to frame, duplicate and trim clips. You can also put voiceover, music and titles.

For this conquest we are developing our last project wich is creating a platform were journalist will be able to upload their content, as a categorized search engine. So that the journalist can put context into their stories, not only as a xxx space. 

Once we have had the app ready for Android, which was one of our first things to do, we are nearly ready to perform on iOS, which is still in BETA trials.
